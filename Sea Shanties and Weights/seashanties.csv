Hey don't yer see that black cloud a-risin'?
'Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe!

Naow whin Oi wuz a little boy an' so me mother told me,
'Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe!
That if Oi didn't kiss the gals me lips would all grow mouldy.
'Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe!

An' Oi sailed the seas for many a year not knowin' what Oi wuz missin',
Then Oi sets me sails afore the gales an' started in a-kissin'.

Naow first Oi got a Spanish gal an' she wuz fat an' lazy,
An' then Oi got a [Negro] tart-she nearly druv me crazy.

Oi found meself a Yankee gal an' sure she wasn't civil,
So Oi stuck a plaster on her back an' set her to the Divil.

Sheepskin, pitch, an' beeswax, they make a bully plaster;
The more she tried ter git it off it only stuck the faster.

Then Oi got meself an Oirish gal an' her name wuz Flannigan,
She stole me boots, she stole me clothes, she pinched me plate an' pannikin.

Oi courted then a Frenchie gal, she took things free an' aisy,
But naow Oi've got an English gal an' sure she is a daisy.

So list while Oi sing ter yer about me darlin' Nancy,
She's copper-bottomed, clipper-built, she's jist me style an' fancy.

Ye may talk about yer Yankee gals an' round-the-corner-Sallies,
But they couldn't make the grade, me bhoys, wid the gals from down our alley.

We sailed away for the China Seas, our bhoys so neat an' handy,
The Ould Man in his cab'n, bhoys, a-drinkin' rum an' brandy.

We loaded for the homeward run, all hands so free an' aisy,
And in his galley sat the doc, a-makin' plum-duff graisy.

We squared our yards an' away we rolled, with the fiddles playin' handy,
Wid a roll 'n' go, an' a westward ho, an' a Yankee Doodle Dandy.

Oh, King Louis wuz the King o' France, afore the revolution,
But the people cut his big head orf an' spoiled his constitution.

Then they sent the King away ter sea, to larn him how ter swim,
They sent him wid a Bluenose mate who put a squarehead on him.

Oh, once Oi wuz in Oireland a-diggin' turf an' taties,
But naow Oi'm on a Limejuice ship an' a-haulin' on the braces.

Saint Patrick wuz a gintleman, an' he come of daycent paypul,
He built a church in Dublin town an' on it set a staypul.

From Oireland thin he druv the snakes, then drank up all the whisky,
This made him dance an' sing an' jig, he felt so fine an' frisky.

He held High Mass for forty days before he blessed the staypul,
He held High Mass, 'twas a sorry pass, but he couldn't fool the paypul.

Yiz call yerself a second mate an' cannot tie a bowline,
Ye cannot even stand up straight when the packet she's a-rollin'.

Said she "Young man that's quite a thrill."

I put my lips upon her lips,
Said she "Mm mm mm mm mm mm."

'Twas off to sea I sadly went.

When then I did set out to sea,
She said that she'd be true to me.

A soldier had her on his knee.",

That land of promise there you'll see,

Across the western ocean.

To Liverpool I'll take my way,
Amelia, whar' you bound to?
To Liverpool that Yankee school,
Across the western ocean.

There's Liverpool Pat with his tarpaulin hat,
Amelia, whar' you bound to?
And Yankee John the packet rat,

Beware these packet-ships, I pray,

They steal your stores and clothes away,

Now shipmates listen unto me, I'll tell you with my song,
Of the things that happened to me, when I come home from Hong Kong.

Then away you Santy, my dear Annie,
Oh, you New York girls, can't you dance the polka.

As I walked down beside the docks, a fair maid I did meet.
She asked me for to see her home, and she lived on Bleecker Street.

Says I my dear young lady, I'm a stranger here in town,
Left my ship just yesterday, and for Boston I am bound.

Says she if you'll come with me, then you will have a treat,
For you shall have some brandy, and something nice to eat.

When we got down to Bleecker Street, we stopped at forty-four,
An' there her twenty sisters were waiting at the door.

They gave me wine that tasted fine, but it went right to my head,
Then they threw their clothes away, and they carried me to bed.

When I awoke next morning, I had an aching head.
My clothes and all money, and my lady friends had left.

Lord, I don't miss the money, as some other sailors might,
But I wish I could remember, if I had some fun that night.

Farewell an' adieu to you ladies of Spain,
For we've received orders for to sail for old England,
An' hope very shortly to see you again.

We'll rant an' we'll roar, like true British sailors,
We'll rant an' we'll rave across the salt seas,

From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-four leagues.

We hove our ship to, with the wind at sou'west, boys,
We hove our ship to for to take soundings clear.
In fifty-five fathoms with a fine sandy bottom,
We filled our maintops'l, up Channel did steer.

The first land we made was a point called the Deadman,
Next Ramshead off Plymouth, Start, Portland, and Wight.
We sailed then by Beachie, by Fairlee and Dungeyness,
Then bore straight away for the South Foreland Light.

Now the signal was made for the Grand Fleet to anchor,
We clewed up our tops'ls, stuck out tacks and sheets.
We stood by our stoppers, we brailed in our spankers,
And anchored ahead of the noblest of fleets.

Let every man here drink up his full bowl,
And let us be jolly and drown melancholy,
Drink a health to each jovial an' true-hearted soul.",

Oh, as I strolled out one evening, out for a night's career,
I met a lofty clipper ship an' arter her I steered.
I hoisted her me sig-a-nals, which she so quickly knew,
An' when she seed me bunting fly, she immediately hove to-o-o,

Oh, she'd a dark an' rollin' eye,
An' her hair hung down in ring-a-lets,
She wuz a nice gal, a decent gal,
But one of the rakish kind!

Kind sir, ye must excuse me, for being out so late,
For if me parents knew o' it, then sad would be me fate,
Me father he's a minister, a true and honest man,
Me mother she's a Methodist, an' I do the best I can.

I eyed that wench full warily, for talk like this I knew,
She seemed a little owerbold, she lied for all I knew,
But still she wuz a comely wench, her lips a ruby red,
Her bosom full, her hips so slim, she coyly hung her head.

I took her to a tavern an' treated her to wine,
Little did I think that she belonged to the rakish kind.
I handled her, I dangled her, an' found to my surprise,
She wuz nothin' but a fire ship, rigged up in a disguise.

And so I deemed her company for a sailorman like me.
I kissed her once, I kissed her twice, said she, `Be nice to me.'
I fondled her, I cuddled her, I bounced her on me knee.
She wept, she sighed an' then she cried, `Jack, will ye sleep wi' me?'

(Two verses omitted.)

Now all ye jolly sailormen that sail the Western Sea,
An' all ye jolly 'prentice lads a warnin' take from me,
Steer clear o' lofty fire ships, for me they left well-spent.

"When first I went to Frisco boys, I went upon a spree,
My hard earned cash I spent it fast, I got drunk as drunk could be,
Before me money was all gone, or spent on some old whore,
I made up me mind and was well inclined to go to sea no more.

No more, no more, To go to sea no more,
I made up me mind and was well inclined to go to sea no more.

That night I spent with Sally Brown too drunk to roll in bed,
Me clothes was new me money was too, in the morn with them she fled.
A feeling sick I left the house and went down to the shore.
There I went me head all bend and the crimps at me did roar.

Did roar, did roar, the crimps at me did roar.
There I went, me head all bent and the crimps at me did roar.

The first chap I ran afoul of was Mr. Shanghai Brown.
Well I asked him neat if he'd stand the treat; he looks me up and down.
He said "The last time yer was paid off you chalked me up no score.
But I'll give yes a chance and I'll take yer advance, and send yer to sea once more."

Once more, once more, I'll send you to sea once more,
I'll give yes a chance and I'll take yer advance, and I'll send yer to sea once more."

They shipped me aboard of a whaling ship bound for the Arctic Sea.
Where them cold winds blow and the ice and snow would even make Jamaica rum freeze.
I had no clothes I had no gear, me money spent on a whore,
T'was then I swore that when on shore I'd go to sea no more.

No more, no more, I'd go to sea no more,
T'was then I swore that when on shore I'd go to sea no more.

Some times we caught them sperm whales boys and sometimes we caught none.
With a twenty-foot oar stuck in yer paw you pulled the whole day long,
And when the night it came around and yer nodded on your oar,
A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.

Once more, once more, To go to sea once more,
A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.

So come all you bully sailor lads and listen to me song.
If you listen to me I'll tell to you and let you know what went wrong.
Take my advice don't drink strong rum nor go drinking with no whore.
Get married instead and spend all night in bed and go to sea no more.

No more, no more, and go to sea no more,
Get married instead and spend all night in bed and go to sea no more.",

Now comes that damned old compass, it will grieve your heart full sore.
For theirs is two-and-thirty points and we have forty-four.

Next comes the running rigging, which you're all supposed to know;

I spy'd three ships from France, to them I did advance,
And took them all by chance, as I sail'd.

I spy'd three ships of Spain, as I sail'd, as I sail'd,
I spy'd three ships of Spain, as I sail'd,
I spy'd three ships of Spain, I fired on them amain,
Till most of them were slain, as I sail'd.

I'd ninety bars of gold, as I sail'd, as I sail'd,
I'd ninety bars of gold, as I sail'd,
I'd ninety bars of gold and dollars manifold,
With riches uncontrolled, as I sail'd.

Then fourteen ships I saw, as I sail'd, as I sail'd,
Then fourteen ships I saw, as I sail'd,
Then fourteen ships I saw and brave men they were,
Ah! they were too much for me, as I sail'd.

Thus being o'ertaken at last, I must die, I must die,
Thus being o'ertaken at last, I must die,
Thus being o'ertaken at last, and into prison cast
And sentence being passed, I must die.

Farewell the raging main, I must die, I must die,
Farewell the raging main, I must die,
Farewell the raging main, to Turkey, France, and Spain,
I ne'er shall see you again, I must die.

To Newgate now I'm cast, and must die, and must die,
To Newgate now I'm cast, and must die,
To Newgate now I'm cast, with a sad and heavy heart,
To receive my just desert, I must die.

To Execution Dock I must go, I must go,
To Execution Dock I must go,
To Execution Dock will many thousand flock,
But I must bear the shock, I must die.

Come all you young and old, see me die, see me die,
Come all you young and old, see me die,
Come all you young and old, you're welcome to my gold,
For by it I've lost my soul, and must die.

Take warning now by me, for I must die, for I must die,
Take warning now by me, for I must die,
Take warning now by me, and shun bad company,
Lest you come to hell with me, for I must die. ",

'Twas in eighteen hundred and fifty-three
And of June the thirteenth day,
That our gallant ship her anchor weighed,
And for Greenland bore away, brave boys,
And for Greenland bore away.

The lookout in the crosstrees stood,
With his spyglass in his hand.
"There's a whale, there's a whale, there's a whalefish," he cried,
"And she blows at every span, brave boys,
And she blows at every span."

The captain stood on the quarter-deck,
And a fine little man was he.
"Overhaul! Overhaul! Let your davit-tackles fall,
And launch your boats for sea, brave boys,
And launch your boats for sea."

Now the boats were launched and the men aboard,
And the whale was in full view;
Resolv-ed was each seaman bold
To steer where the whalefish blew, brave boys,
To steer where the whalefish blew.

We struck that whale, the line paid out,
But she gave a flourish with her tail;
The boat capsized and four men were drowned,
And we never caught that whale, brave boys,
And we never caught that whale.

"To lose the whale," our captain said,
"It grieves my heart full sore;
But oh! to lose four gallant men,
It grieves me ten times more, brave boys,
It grieves me ten times more."

"The winter star doth now appear,
So boys, we'll anchor weigh;
It's time to leave this cold country,
And homeward bear way, brave boys,
And homeward bear away."

Oh, Greenland is a dreadful place,
A land that's never green,
Where there's ice and snow, and the whalefishes blow,
And the daylight's seldom seen, brave boys,
And the daylight's seldom seen.",
"
Come cheer up my lads, it's to glory we steer,
To add something more to this wonderful year.
To honor we call you, as free men, not slaves,
For who are so free as the sons of the waves.

Heart of oak are our ships,
Heart of oak are our men.
We always are ready,
Steady, boys, steady,
We'll fight and we'll conquer, again and again.

Our worthy forefathers, let's give them a cheer,
To climates unknown did courageously steer.
Through oceans to deserts, for freedom they came,
And dying, bequeathed us their freedom and fame.

"There were two lofty ships from old England came,
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we;
One was the Prince of Luther, and the other Prince of Wales,
Cruising down along the coast of the High Barbaree.

"Aloft there, aloft!" our jolly boatswain cries,
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we;
"Look ahead, look astern, look aweather and alee,
Look along down the coast of the High Barbaree."

There's nought upon the stern, there's nought upon the lee,
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we;
But there's a lofty ship to windward, and she's sailing fast and free,
Sailing down along the coast of the High Barbaree.

"Oh, hail her, Oh, hail her," our gallant captain cried,
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we;
"Are you a man-o'-war or a privateer," said he,
"Cruising down along the coast of the High Barbaree."

"Oh, I am not a man-o'-war nor privateer," said he,
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we;
"But I'm a salt-sea pirate a-looking for my fee,
"Cruising down the coast of the High Barbaree."

Oh, 'twas broadside to broadside a long time we lay,
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we;
Until the Prince of Luther shot the pirate's masts away,
Cruising down along the coast of the High Barbaree.

"Oh, quarter, Oh, quarter," those pirates then did cry,
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we;
But the quarter that we gave them - we sunk them in the sea,
Coming down along the coast of the High Barbaree. ",
"
As I walked out one morning in May,
For my recreation my thoughts far away,
Whilst I lay me down at full length on the grass,
Oh, who should come near but a fair Indian lass.

She sat down by my side and gently pressed my hand
Saying "You are a stranger in this our distant land.
Then come to the parson's and there marry me,
And I'll teach you the language of the little Mohea."

Then sun was fast rising from off the salt sea
When I wandered off with this lass of Mohea.
Together we wandered, together we roved,
Till we came to her hut in the coconut grove.

This pretty Kanaka was modest and kind,
She acted her part with a virtuous mind,
And being a stranger far away from my home,
I'll never forget her wherever I roam.

'Twas early one morning, one morning in May,
That to this fair maiden these words I did say:
"I'm going to leave you, so farewell, my dear,
My ship's sails are loosed and home I must steer."

Oh, the last time I saw her 'twas down on the strand,
And as our boat passed by her, she waved her hand,
Saying "When you get back to the ones that you love
Pray think of the lass in the coconut grove."

Since then I'm safe landed on my own native shore,
And my friends and relations flock round me once more
And though many I look at, not one can I see
That I can compare with the lass of Mohea.",
"I'm singing this song to the one I love best,
And her picture is tattooed all over my chest.

Hay ho little fishes, don't cry, don't cry.
Hay ho little fishes, don't cry, don't cry.

I've a picture of her mother also on my back,
And on my stomach flies the Union Jack

There are fish in the sea there's no doubt about it,
Just as fine as the ones that ever came out of it.

Little fish when he's caught he fights like a bull whale,
That thrashes the water with his mighty tail.

The ship's underway and the weather is fine.
The skipper's down aft hanging out other lines.

The crew are asleep and the ocean's at rest,
And I'm singing this song to the one I love best.

"One Friday morn when we set sail,
Not very far from land,
We there did espy a fair pretty maid
With a comb and a glass in her hand, her hand, her hand,
With a comb and a glass in her hand.

While the raging seas did roar,
And the stormy winds did blow,
While we jolly sailor-boys were up unto the top,
And the land-lubbers lying down below, below, below,
And the land-lubbers lying down below.

Then up starts the capt'n of our gallant ship,
And a brave young man was he;
`I've a wife and child in fair Bristol town,
But a widow I fear she will be.'

Then up starts the mate of our gallant ship,
And a bold young man was he;
`Oh, I have a wife in fair Portsmouth town,
But a widow I fear she will be,'

Then up starts the cook of our gallant ship,
And a gruff old soul was he;
`Oh, I have a wife in Plymouth town,
But a widow I fear she will be.'

And then up spoke the little cabin-boy,
And a pretty little boy was he;
`Oh, I am more grieved for my daddy and my mammy,
Than you for your wives all three.'

Then three times round went our gallant ship,
And three times round went she;
For the want of a life-boat they all went down,
And she sank to the bottom of the sea.",
"
It's a damned tough life, full of toil and strife
We whalermen undergo.
And we don't give a damn when the gale has stopped
How hard the wind did blow.
We're homeward bound! 'Tis a grand old sound
On a good ship taut and free,
And we don't give a damn when we drink our rum
With the girls on old Maui.

Rolling down to old Maui, my boys,
Rolling down to old Maui.
We're homeward bound from the arctic ground
Rolling home to old Maui.

Once more we sail with a northerly gale
Through the ice and sleet and rain.
And them coconut fronds in them tropic lands
We soon shall see again.
Six hellish months we've passed away
In the cold Kamchatka sea,
And now we're bound from the arctic ground,
Rolling down to old Maui.

We'll heave the lead where old Diamondhead
Looms up on old Wahoo.
Our mast and yards are sheathed with ice
And our decks are hid from view.
The horrid tiles of the sea-cut ice
That deck the Arctic Sea
Are miles behind in the frozen wind
Since we steered for old Maui.

How soft the breeze of the tropic seas
Now the ice is far astern,
And them native maids in them island glades
Are awaiting our return.
Even now their big black eyes look out
Hoping some fine day to see
Our baggy sails running 'fore the gales
Rolling down to old Maui.

And now we sail with a favoring gale
Towards our island home.
Our mainmast sprung, our whaling done,
And we ain't got far to roam.
Our stuns'l booms are carried away
What care we for that sound?
A living gale is after us,
Thank God we're homeward bound!

And now we're anchored in the bay
With the Kanakas all around
With chants and soft aloha oes
They greet us homeward bound.
And now ashore we'll have good fun
We'll paint them beaches red
Awaking in the arms of a wahine
With a big fat aching head.

"We come on the Sloop John B., my grandfather and me.
Around Nassau town we did roam.
Drinking all night, got into a fight,
Well I feel so break up, I want to go home.

So hoist up the John B's sails, see how the main sail sets,
Call for the captain ashore, and let me go home.
Let me go home, I want to go home,
Well I feel so break up, I want to go home.

The first mate, he got drunk, broke up the people's trunk,
The constable had to come and take him away.
Sheriff John Stone, why don't you leave me alone?
Well I feel so break up, I want to go home.

So hoist up the John B's sails, see how the main sail sets,
Call for the captain ashore, and let me go home.
Let me go home, I want to go home,
Well I feel so break up, I want to go home.

The poor cook he caught the fits, threw away all my grits,
Then he took and ate up all of my corn.

"Oh the year was seventeen seventy eight
I wish I were in Sherbrooke now!
A letter of marque came from the King
To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen
God Damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's privateers.

Oh Elcid Barrett cried the town,
I wish I were in Sherbrooke now!
For twenty brave men, all fishermen, who
Would make for him the Antelope's crew,
God Damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's privateers.

The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight.
She'd a list to port and her sails in rags,
And a cook in the scuppers with staggers and jags.

On the King's birthday we put to sea.
We were ninety-one days to Montego bay,
Pumping like madmen all the way.

On the ninety-sixth day we sailed again.
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight
With our cracked four-pounders we made to fight

The Yankee lay low down with gold.
She was broad and fat and loose in stays,
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days

Then at length we stood two cables away.
Our cracked four-pounders made an awful din,
But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in.

The Antelope shook and pitched on her side.
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs,
And the maintruck carried off both me legs.

So here I lay in my twenty-third year.
It's been six years since we sailed away,
And I just made Halifax yesterday. ",

M' father often told me, when I was just a lad,
A sailor's life was very hard, the food was always bad,
But now I've joined the navy, I'm on board a man-o-war,
And now I find a sailor ain't a sailor any more!

Don't haul on the rope, don't climb up the mast,
If you see a sailing-ship it might be your last,
Get your civvies ready for another run ashore,
A sailor ain't a sailor ain't a sailor any more!

The 'killick' of our mess, he says we've had it soft,
It wasn't like this in his day, when he was up aloft,
We like our bunks and sleeping bags but what's a hammock for?
Swinging from the deckhead or lying on the floor?

They gave us an engine that first went up and down,
Then with more technology the engine went around,
We're good with steam and diesel but what's a mainyard for?
A stoker ain't a stoker with a shovel any more!

They gave us an Aldis Lamp, we can do it right,
They gave us a radio, we signal day and night,
We know our codes and ciphers but what's a 'sema' for?
A 'bunting-tosser' doesn't toss the bunting any more!

They gave us a radar set to pierce the fog and gloom,
So now the lookout's sitting in a tiny darkened room,
Loran does navigation the Sonar says how deep,
The Jimmy's 3 sheets to the wind, the Skipper's fast asleep.

Two cans of beer a day, that's your bleeding lot!
But now we gets an extra one because they stopped The Tot,
So, we'll put on our civvy-clothes and find a pub ashore,
A sailor's still a sailor, just like he was before!",

Fifteen men on a dead man's chest
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
Drink and the devil had done for the rest
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.
The mate was fixed by the bosun's pike
The bosun brained with a marlinspike
And cookey's throat was marked belike
It had been gripped by fingers ten;
And there they lay, all good dead men
Like break o'day in a boozing ken
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.

Fifteen men of the whole ship's list
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
Dead and be damned and the rest gone whist!
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
The skipper lay with his nob in gore
Where the scullion's axe his cheek had shore
And the scullion he was stabbed times four
And there they lay, and the soggy skies
Dripped down in up-staring eyes
In murk sunset and foul sunrise
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.

Fifteen men of 'em stiff and stark
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
Ten of the crew had the murder mark!
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
'Twas a cutlass swipe or an ounce of lead
Or a yawing hole in a battered head
And the scuppers' glut with a rotting red
And there they lay, aye, damn my eyes
Looking up at paradise
All souls bound just contrawise
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.

Fifteen men of 'em good and true
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
Ev'ry man jack could ha' sailed with Old Pew,
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
There was chest on chest of Spanish gold
With a ton of plate in the middle hold
And the cabins riot of stuff untold,
And they lay there that took the plum
With sightless glare and their lips struck dumb
While we shared all by the rule of thumb,
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!

More was seen through a sternlight screen...
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
Chartings undoubt where a woman had been
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.
'Twas a flimsy shift on a bunker cot
With a dirk slit sheer through the bosom spot
And the lace stiff dry in a purplish blot
Oh was she wench or some shudderin' maid
That dared the knife and took the blade
By God! she had stuff for a plucky jade
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.

Fifteen men on a dead man's chest
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
Drink and the devil had done for the rest
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.
We wrapped 'em all in a mains'l tight
With twice ten turns of a hawser's bight
And we heaved 'em over and out of sight,
With a Yo-Heave-Ho! and a fare-you-well
And a sudden plunge in the sullen swell
Ten fathoms deep on the road to hell,

Binks sake in the hold as we sail through the breeze
Far across the eye can see, the sun is shining merrily
As the birds fly in the sky as they sing out with glee
Bid adieu to everyone, as we sail under the the sun
Sailing on from dusk ‘til dawn and singing out as one
Cross the gold and silver waves, changing into water sprays
Sailing out on our journey to the ends of the sea

Let be shown that we are known as pirates sailing free
Time to raise the flag up high, of Jolly Roger in the sky
Raise the sails and tell the tales that never pass you by
Somewhere in the endless sky, a storm has started coming by
Waves a-dancing, sails a-prancing through the wind and rain
If we let blow winds of fear, then the end of us is near
Even so tomorrow the sun rise again

Through today and through tomorrow all your dreams will lay
Say goodbye should we depart, and keep your memories in your heart
Don’t you frown and don’t feel down but live to seize the day

Sailing on from dusk ‘til dawn and singing out as one
After all is said and done, we all end up as skeletons
Tales unending, rules a-bending, journey just begun
