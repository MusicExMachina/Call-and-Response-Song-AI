Saying "you play the cribbage and I'll stick the pegs"
Singing blow the wind westerly, let the wind blow
By a gentle nor'wester how steady she goes

Up jumps a dolphin with his chuckle-head
He jumps on the deck saying "pull out the lead!"

Up jumps a flounder so flat on the ground
Saying "damn your old chocolate, mind how you sound"

Up jumps a salmon so bright as the sun
He jumped down between the decks and fired off a gun

Up jumps a whale, the biggest of all
He jumped up aloft and he's pawl after pawl

Up jumps a herring, the king of the sea
He jumps up on deck saying "helms a-lee!"

Up jumps a shark with his big row of teeth
He jumped up between the decks and shook out the reefs",

When in comes Archie with a smile
"Drink up me boys, it's worth your while"

When poor Jack's money is gone and spent
Nor more to be had, no more to be lent
Then in comes Archie with a frown
Saying "Rise up Jack, let John sit down"

There's ships in the harbour needing hands
So stows his gear like he did before
And says farewell to the Liverpool shore

Then put out to sea for the port of New York
And it's row, row bullies row

For 42 days we were hungry and sore
The winds were against us, the gales they did roar
Off Battery Point we did anchor at last
Our jib boom hove in and our canvas all fast

A shouting and a promising all that was nice
Til one fat old crib took a liking to me

Says he there's a job as is waiting for you
With lashings of liquor and beggar-all to do
Says he what you say lad, will you ? or two
Says I you old bastard, I'm damned if I do

On a the three skysail yarder bound south round Cape Horn
With an old set of oilskins and two pair of socks
And a blooming great head and a case of the pox

Don't pay no attention to runner or whore
Or your head'll be thick and your throat will be sore",
